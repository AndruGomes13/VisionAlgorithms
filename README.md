# Monocular Visual Odometry Project

## Course Information
**Institution:** University of Zurich (UZH) and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)  
**Course:** Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics  
**Instructors:** [Instructor Names]

## Project Overview
This project is a part of the Vision Algorithms for Mobile Robotics course, focusing on implementing and understanding the fundamentals of monocular visual odometry. The goal is to develop an algorithm capable of estimating the 3D motion of a single camera moving through a static environment. This technique is critical in the domains of robotics and autonomous vehicles, where understanding the movement relative to the environment is crucial.

## Objectives
- Implement feature detection, matching, and tracking.
- Estimate camera motion from a sequence of images.
- Understand the principles of monocular visual odometry and its applications.
